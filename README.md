# âœ¨ Shinydocs Code in the Dark 2024 âœ¨

To get started:

1. Clone this repository and open it in your IDE of choice
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to run the server

You can make your changes in the following files:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`

If you do **not** want to use Tailwind CSS (or you're not allowed...ðŸ˜’), you can disable it by removing everything in `style.css`.

Remember:

1. You can only use HTML and CSS to make your changes
2. Developers are only allowed to see their IDE while coding, not the browser

Good luck!
